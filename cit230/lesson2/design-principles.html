            Hick-Hyman Law says, "That with every additional choice increases
            the time required to make a decision." If we give a user less decisions they
            will feel more in control of their objective, which in this case is to buy
            organic tampons.

            White space gives life to objects that would otherwise be dull (pun-intended).
            the first thing you see when you look at this screenshot is the bright orange razor. 
            Next you see Harry's shaving gel and then the red button at the bottom calling you to action.
            This site has properly used the negative space to bring what is most important to your attention.

    <h1>Fitt's Law - Patagonia Clothing</h1>

            <p>
             Fitt's Law says, "The time required to move to a target area is a function of the distance 
             to the target and the size of the target." When looking at Patagonia on a small window they 
             know you are there to shop. They have made this clear by filling the entire space you see on
             the buttons you are most likely to click.
